great acting. excellent movie! how can a movie with william h macy, neve campbell and donald sutherland go wrong? i wonder why i never heard of it before.\n","1\n","kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! the plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. a very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. the movie i kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? the best part of this movie is the scenery\n","0\n","turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of my boyfriend's back! only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you're watching this. it's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max. we get a name like \"johnny\" every so often, and this \"johnny\" has nowhere to go. there isn't a specific reason to why our \"dead corpse\" crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night, so that renders the movie totally useless. without a feeling of sorrow, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead. johnny takes a bite out of eddie's arm afterwards. the viewer is asked a tough question: why does the movie have to be this cornball? there is an answer. any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental. \"living\" is a coincidence. \"dead\" has nothing in common with the movie. show this one to your girlfriend and she'll skip the senior prom, turning your life into a deserted ruin. blah!!!\n","0\n","\n","test\n","to be fair, it has been several years since i watched the bile committed to celluloid known as \"here on earth,\" so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little sketchy. i'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer.<br /><br />scene one: chris klein, after having been thrown out of prep school (because he looks like a seventeen year old--yes, very believable), gives what i assume is his valedictorian speech...to a field. let me repeat that for you--a field. i think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence he is failing to express. klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. he is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but little more.<br /><br />scene two: after some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks, chris klein and josh hartnett do some damage to the local diner, of which he is forced to rebuild. of course. because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it/ burned it in the first place. better yet, let's have said random moron move in on josh hartnett's girl, miss sobeski, the girl he fancies for...her equally wooden line delivery? <br /><br />scene three: chris klein's character is making out with leelee sobeski's character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern seaboard. my soul weeps. really, how can this scenario turn out well? surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to miss sobeski's more...erm...feminine areas. secondly, naming her breasts after new york and new jersey prompts some confusion as to whether miss sobeski is actually freakishly disproportionate.<br /><br />scene four: leelee is running. she falls down. this gives her...knee cancer. \"we always knew it could come back,\" her father(?) says. right. knee cancer. from tripping. perhaps i missed something. as i said, it's been a few years. surely i missed something. didn't i? for the love of god, please tell me the girl did not contract knee cancer from falling down. <br /><br />that scream you just heard was my soul dying.\n","0\n","i watched this film not knowing anything about it. i had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. how wrong i was. the plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. i am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as i thought it was quite unusual. if you liked the film se7en (seven) with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this. there is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all. it is all about the plot, about building the characters and building an atmosphere. it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great. i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not.......\n","1\n","tumbling doll of flesh (aka niku daruma and psycho: the snuff reels) this was on my want list for quite a while, and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back. it's never been on dvd, and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd-r, which i'm quite satisfied with. the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. the porn is definitely real, with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat, and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest. this is after both legs have been severed, her arm, and a few other niceities. this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot, in fact, they are not even close to the realism, although cheap gore effects, shown in this movie. this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen, if not the best. now i must warn you, that if you are not into this stuff, you should stay far far away. this movie is very strong, and with the real sex, it is in a very sick way, erotic to an extent. and i mean, in a very sick way. but wherever you come down on this subject material, this movie brings the goods home, and i would definitely recommend you seek it out. after reading about the movie, i was expecting something very strong, but it exceeded that by a bunch.\n","1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"u-W5LHB7-04I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630668888345,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"松谷尚也","photoUrl":"","userId":"01856268470104492017"}}},"source":["import

In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?.

They decided to the block railway line after the administration forcibly removed them from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway site. The expressway is meant to decongest Delhi with an aim to reduce air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Supreme Court, in 2006, had  directed the Centre to build the expressway as soon as possible. The National Highways Authority of India said 17km of the expressway falls in 39 villages of Greater Noida. Farmers are demanding that instead of the Rs 3,640 per square metre compensation that they were promised, the district administration should pay them four times the prevailing circle rate. This roughly works out to Rs 7,000 per sqm.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate this EPE on August 15 and the district administration is under pressure to settle farmer disputes. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(HT Photo)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Eastern Peripheral Expressway is a project of national importance as the Supreme Court has ordered its construction. Farmers should fight for increased compensation at the right platform instead of blocking trains or protesting at the expressway site. If anyone disturbs law and order, we will take action,? said BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate this EPE on August 15 and the district administration is under pressure to settle farmer disputes. However, farmers are angry with the administration for filing an FIR and forcibly removing them from the EPE site.?This is a democratic country and we have every right to protest. We were peacefully protesting in Bil Akbarpur. Why did the administration and police remove us? And now they are putting pressure on us to snatch our land. The UP government has paid Rs 17,000 per sqm as compensation in nearby Ghaziabad villages. In some cases, it has paid Rs 6,300 per sqm as compensation. Why should we give our land for Rs 3,640 per sqm?? said Sunil Fauji, a farmer leader named in the FIR. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and the police on Friday lodged an FIR against 20 farmers for blocking the passage of Haldia Express train on the Delhi-Howrah railway line that passes through Greater Noida.**Photo recieved on July 28.2017. (Please check with Charmaine Edwards for details) ?The land compensation rate should be uniform for all EPE farmers or they should acquire land under the 2013 Land Acquisition Act,? he said.In 2006, the district administration had paid Rs 1,700 per sqm to farmers, who willingly gave their land for the project. Later, in 2016, then district magistrate NP Singh increased the compensation to Rs 3,500 per sqm. Now, DM BN Singh has decided to award Rs 3,640 per sqm, including Rs 5 lakh to each farmer family. ?A majority of farmers are willing to give their land for Rs 3,640 per sqm. But a few farmers, nurturing political ambitions, are provoking others. These leaders do not have land in these 39 villages,? the DM claimed.Construction work on the EPE in Panipat, Faridabad and Ghaziabad and other areas, except Gautam Budh Nagar, is on in full swing.

As the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to be the major representation of the United States' second wave of coffee culture.[3][4] As of September 2020, the company had 32,660 stores in 83 countries, including 16,637 company operated stores and 16,023 licensed stores.[2] Of these 32,660 stores, 18,354 were in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.[2] Starbucks locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations offer free Wi-Fi.\n","\n","Headquartered in the Starbucks Center, the company was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – decided to make the coffee bean store a coffeeshop serving espresso-based drinks. Schultz's first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the Midwestern United States and British Columbia, the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into California in the early 1990s through a series of highly publicized coffee wars. Schultz was succeeded by Orin Smith who ran the company for five years, positioning Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee and increasing sales to $5 billion. Jim Donald served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around corporate social responsibility. Kevin Johnson succeeded Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n","\n","Many stores sell pre-packaged food items, pastries, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and tumblers. There are also several select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations which offer beer, wine, and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are sold at grocery stores in the United States and other countries. In 2010, the company began its Starbucks Reserve program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by the end of 2017.[5] Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. The latest roastery location opened on Chicago's Magnificent Mile in November 2019, and is the world's largest Starbucks location. The company has received significant criticism about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial brand loyalty, market share, and company value.\n","\"\"\""],"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Jpf0s7i79EvJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630694485261,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":605,"user":{"displayName":"松谷尚也","photoUrl":"","userId":"01856268470104492017"}},"outputId":"dd8bba76-eebf-4de6-cd0b-a66015bf3df1"},"source":["encoded_text_mask = tokenizer.encode_plus(english_text,\n","                                          max_length = 256,\n","                                          pad_to_max_length = True,\n","                                          return_tensors = \"pt\")"],"execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2204: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length.
